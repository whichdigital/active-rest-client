# THIS GEM IS DEPRECATED

As the last code commit to this gem was in September 2015, Andy Jeffries forked the gem and actively maintains his fork under the new name of Flexirest.  You should switch your code over to using Flexirest.

## How?

Migration over to Flexirest is easy, Andy wrote a [simple guide](https://github.com/andyjeffries/flexirest/blob/master/Migrating-from-ActiveRestClient.md).

## I don't want to, where have the docs gone?

If you really don't want the bug fixes and new features being built in Flexirest and would rather stay using ActiveRestClient, the original README (all the docs for ActiveRestClient) are [still available](README-FULL.md)
